# Simple EmailJS Template - No Corruption Issues

## The Problem
The "Template: One or more dynamic variables are corrupted" error occurs when:
- HTML content is too large
- Special characters in the content
- Base64 image data is too long
- Complex HTML structure

## The Solution
Use a simple plain text template that works reliably.

## EmailJS Template Setup

### Step 1: Go to EmailJS Dashboard
Visit: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/

### Step 2: Edit Your Template
1. Click "Email Templates"
2. Find your template (`template_g6rxkwq`)
3. Click "Edit"

### Step 3: Use This Simple Template
**Template Type:** Plain Text (not HTML)

**Template Content:**
```
Subject: New Order - {{customer_name}} - {{order_time}}

{{message}}
```

**That's it!**

### Step 4: Save and Test
1. Click "Save"
2. Test with a sample order
3. Check your email

## How It Works

The code now sends:
- `{{message}}` - Complete email content as plain text
- All other variables for reference if needed

## Template Variables Available

- `{{message}}` - **Complete email content (use this)**
- `{{customer_name}}`
- `{{customer_email}}`
- `{{customer_phone}}`
- `{{customer_address}}`
- `{{order_details}}`
- `{{total_amount}}`
- `{{order_time}}`
- `{{order_id}}`
