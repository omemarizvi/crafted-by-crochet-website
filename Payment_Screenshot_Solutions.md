# Payment Screenshot Solutions for EmailJS

## The Problem
EmailJS templates cannot display Base64 images directly. The `{{payment_screenshot}}` variable shows as raw Base64 text instead of an actual image.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: HTML Email Template (Recommended)
Update your EmailJS template to use HTML format and include the image as a data URI:

**Template Content (HTML):**
```html
<h2>New Order Received! üõçÔ∏è</h2>

<h3>CUSTOMER DETAILS:</h3>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> {{customer_name}}</p>
<p><strong>Email:</strong> {{customer_email}}</p>
<p><strong>Phone:</strong> {{customer_phone}}</p>
<p><strong>Address:</strong> {{customer_address}}</p>

<h3>ORDER DETAILS:</h3>
<p>{{order_details}}</p>

<h3>TOTAL AMOUNT:</h3>
<p><strong>Rs {{total_amount}}</strong></p>

<h3>ORDER TIME:</h3>
<p>{{order_time}}</p>

<h3>PAYMENT:</h3>
<p>Transfer screenshot uploaded</p>

{{#if payment_screenshot}}
<h3>PAYMENT SCREENSHOT:</h3>
<img src="{{payment_screenshot}}" alt="Payment Screenshot" style="max-width: 500px; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px;">
{{/if}}

```

### Option 2: EmailJS Attachment (Alternative)
Use EmailJS's attachment feature (if supported by your service):

**In your EmailJS template:**
```
PAYMENT SCREENSHOT:
Please check the email attachment for the payment proof.

[The image will be attached as a file]
```

### Option 3: Cloud Storage + Link (Best for Production)
Upload the image to a cloud storage service and send a link:

1. **Use a service like:**
   - Firebase Storage
   - AWS S3
   - Google Cloud Storage
   - Dropbox API

2. **Upload the image** and get a public URL
3. **Include the URL** in the email template

### Option 4: Separate Email with Image
Send two emails:
1. **Order details email** (current)
2. **Payment screenshot email** with the image as attachment

## Current Implementation Status

The current code:
- ‚úÖ Converts uploaded image to Base64
- ‚úÖ Includes Base64 in email parameters
- ‚úÖ Sends email successfully
- ‚ùå Image doesn't display in email (shows as text)

## Recommended Next Steps

### For Quick Fix (Option 1):
1. Go to EmailJS Dashboard
2. Edit your template
3. Change template type to "HTML"
4. Use the HTML template content above
5. The `{{payment_screenshot}}` will display as an actual image

### For Better Solution (Option 3):
1. Set up Firebase Storage or similar
2. Upload images to cloud storage
3. Send image URLs instead of Base64 data
4. Images load faster and emails are smaller

## Testing
After implementing any solution:
1. Test with a small image first
2. Check email in different clients (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Verify images display correctly
4. Test on mobile devices

## Current EmailJS Template Variables
Make sure these are available in your template:
- `{{customer_name}}`
- `{{customer_email}}`
- `{{customer_phone}}`
- `{{customer_address}}`
- `{{order_details}}`
- `{{total_amount}}`
- `{{order_time}}`
- `{{payment_screenshot}}` (Base64 data URI)
